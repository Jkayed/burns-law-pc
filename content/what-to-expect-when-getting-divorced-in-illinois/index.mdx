## The Short Answer

While it may seem daunting at times, the 'final outcome' of divorce proceedings is simple.  First, everyone will walk away with a "Judgment of Dissolution" (a court Order making the divorce 'official') and a "Marital Settlement Agreement" which will define the property rights between the parties.  If the couple has children, they will also walk away with a "Allocation Judgment" (a.k.a. 'Judgment of Allocation of Parental Responsibilities') which will set out how decisions are made regarding the children and what the parenting schedule will be.
So if that's "all" there is, why do divorces take so long?  Read more to find out.

{/* ## Unexpectable Things to Expect

Whatever happens, it will be easier to deal with if we have given it some forethought. The most obvious thing to focus on is the election on November 3rd, but if 2020 has taught us anything so far, it’s that unexpected events can change everything in an instant. Here are a few things to be mentally prepared for.

**Covid gets really ugly.** The virus might survive a little bit longer in the cold air. People may be slightly more likely to congregate inside or slightly less diligent with masking. Each of these can increase the spread.

**Panic buying of food, ammunition, and toilet paper.** The empty shelves we all experienced at the beginning of the pandemic could again become a reality.

**Another police murder.** Protests over the police murder of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Elija McClean, and [others](https://interactive.aljazeera.com/aje/2020/know-their-names/index.html) have waned in numbers and intensity since the peak this summer. Another episode of police violence could very easily bring people back to the streets.

**Normalization of police checkpoints.** If protests re-erupt, authorities may crack down hard. Bill Bar has suggested [charging protestors with sedition](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/09/17/attorney-general-bill-barr-suggests-charging-protesters-sedition/3478435001/). Chicago already has a habit of shutting down all major entrances to the city, raising bridges, and [blockading intersections downtown](https://www.newsweek.com/chicago-police-guard-trump-tower-mexican-independence-day-1532182).

**False Flag Event.** A [false flag operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_flag) is an act of violence committed with the intention of pinning blame on someone else. It is used by political actors to gin up support for war or as an excuse to take away civil liberties from their opponents domestically. Hitler famously set parliament on fire and then used it as an excuse to assume dictatorial powers.

**Spontaneous Political Violence.** This has already occurred. At least [17 people](https://www.fox6now.com/news/deadly-unrest-here-are-the-people-who-have-died-amid-george-floyd-protests-across-us) have died amid the unrest following George Floyd's murder.

**Organized Political Violence.** Aside from seemingly random violence, there is the additional threat of organized violence. By this I mean people organizing themselves for the purpose of committing or threatening violence. Kyle Rittenhouse and the so called "patriot" militias who regularly show up to protests with assault rifles, bullet proof vests, and other tactical gear fall into this category.

**Targeted Political Violence (real or perceived)** - The assassination of any politician would send a shockwave through our system. But even a seemingly natural death could be problematic. The internet is already awash with outlandish conspiracy theories and second, third, and fourth level repercussions could be significant.


## Some Predictions

What I do predict is a very tense and long election season. Here are some specifics that I think are plausible or likely to occur. I’ve included my ballpark percentage likelihood for each, and where alternative outcomes are possible, I’ve labeled them A, B, C, etc.

**IF SOMEONE CONCEDES...**

1. More Democrats will vote by mail than Republicans (99%). This means many Democrat votes will not be counted until after election day

2. **Violence on Election Day (20%).** Long lines, frustrated voters, and a potentially heavy police presence could mean very high tensions on election day. A small fight could escalate to a violent arrest. An internet rumor regarding fraud could cause “patriot militias” to show up with guns to "protect" the election.

3. **OPTION 3A: Trump declares himself the winner on Election night (70%).** If it appears he is ahead in the Electoral College on November 3rd, Trump will not wait to declare himself the winner. Biden's votes are more likely to come via the mail, so he is unlikely to concede.

  **OPTION 3B: Trump declares the election was rigged on Election night (20%).** If it appears he is behind in the Electoral College, Trump will declare that the election was rigged and therefore invalid.

  **OPTION 3C: Trump concedes on election night (10%).** If there is a clear landslide on election night, Trump may be forced do concede if his inner circle, Senate Republicans, and/or military leaders force his hand.

**IF NO ONE CONCEDES...**

4. **OPTION 4A: Trump wins, Biden eventually concedes (25%).** Election officials or courts eventually declare Trump winner. Biden will likely concede. There may be sporadic violence, which Trump will crush with an iron fist.

**OPTION 4B: Biden wins, Trump eventually concedes (20%).** Election officials or courts eventually declare Biden winner and there is a peaceful transition of power. Having declared himself the winner, Trump tweets angrily for weeks as votes are counted. Finally declared the loser, hey may call for violence, but Twitter and facebook quickly shut down his account before anyone acts on it. His generals march into his office and inform him he will be removed by force if necessary. He reluctantly concedes.

**OPTION 4C: Biden wins, Trump challenges (25%).** Election officials or courts eventually declare Biden the winner and there is a period of turmoil and sporadic violence followed by a Biden presidency. Unfortunately, I think this is the most likely end game. I don’t believe Trump will concede under any circumstance. I think he will call for “patriots” to rise up against the evil democrats. If he loses the physical fight, eventually Trump might concede, perhaps making a deal to avoid prosecution as a traitor.

**OPTION 4D: Civil War (5%).** There is no shortage of people advocating for a civil war already. Ammunition and guns are sold out across the country. The only reason this percentage isn’t higher is because I've retained an irrational optimism that cooler heads will prevail.

**OPTION 4E. Intervening Event (25%).** I make no attempt to describe what this event could be. Let’s call it the 2020 wild card scenario. It could be a natural disaster, a false flag operation, or a spontaneous popular uprising. It could calm the situation or enflame it. Whatever it is, it could change the landscape in an instant.

## Conclusions

Things do not look good. There are still paths forward, but we cannot afford to live in denial. Only one presidential candidate has clearly and unequivocally denounced political violence of any kind. The other has a history of encouraging violence and demonizing opponents as evil scum.

As Maya Angelou put it, "When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time." We cannot wish our way into calmer waters. We must stare the ugliness in the face, buckle down, and weather this storm, together.
