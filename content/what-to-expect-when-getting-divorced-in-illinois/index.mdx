## The Short Answer

While it may seem daunting at times, the 'final outcome' of divorce proceedings is simple.  In divorce law, all roads lead to a "Prove Up" court date, where the divorce is finalized.  After much negotiation of the terms, at the Prove Up court date, the judge will enter two or three final Orders:
-*Judgment of Dissolution ("JDM")* - An Order declaring the parties are divorced.
-*Marital Settlement Agreement ("MSA")* - An agreement between parties which defines all property rights between the parties.
-*Allocation Judgment ("AJ") - An Order defining parenting responsibilities, parenting schedule, and other details of co-parenting (only needed when the parties have a child together).

In some way, all of the Court's proceedings are designed to help the parties come to agreement on the JDM, MSA, and AJ.  And that's it, you're divorced! So if that's "all" there is, why do divorces take so long?  Read more to find out.

## Getting Started

To start with, there are some procedural steps required to start a divorce proceeding.  One party must file a 'Petition for Dissolution of Marriage,' which is essentially a request for the Court to dissolve the marriage (i.e., divorce). Once filed, they must provide notice to the other party, and there are strict legal requirements for getting this done.  Even after getting served, the other party may argue that the Court should not be hearing the case.  If this happens, the court must first decide whether or not it should be deciding the divorce in the first place.  Some cases get stuck for weeks or months before they even get going.

## Discovery
Once both sides are engaged in the dispute, they have an opportunity to get full disclosure from the other side of facts relevant to the case.  For example, one side can request the other side's bank records, and the other side must produce them.  This could take a couple of days, but often one side does not produce the documents. The other side has other ways to secure the documents they need.  They can issue a subpoena for the records.  Or they can file a Motion to Compel, asking that the Court issue an Order requiring the other side to produce documents.  All of these options can take multiple court dates to decide and Discovery can easily take several months even when both sides are moving relatively quickly.

## Pleadings
As the case is going on, one side or the other can file a Motion for the court to decide one issue or another.  For example, one side can ask the Court to Order that the other side leave the marital home.  Or one parent can file a Motion asking that the court Order the other side to pay child support while the proceedings play out.  Each of these pleadings can require several court dates and thus several months to resolve.


## 'Temporary' Orders and 'Agreed' Orders
So what moves things forward?  Generally speaking, the parties will agree to short-term solutions for small pieces of the overall settlement.  Whether agreed to by the parties or issued by the Court, Orders are ultimately what create progress. 

## More Professionals/Attorneys?!?
Often times the parties will not agree and the Court will Order them to seek the help of another qualified professional to help resolve an issue. The Court can appoint a Guardian Ad Litem or a Child Representative.  There are differences between the two, but both of these appointed attorneys are tasked with helping ensure the children's best interests are served by the court.  And the parties (usually) have to share the costs.

## Pretrial
If the parties still cannot come to agreement on the terms of their MSA or AJ, they may be willing to go to trial.  At trial, the Judge will listen to testimony from the parties and any other witnesses, consider all the evidence, and then the Judge will decide the terms of the MSA and/or AJ.  Trial can be very time consuming and expensive and risky, so Illinois requires the parties to meet with the court for a "Pretrial" proceeding where the Court will work with the attorneys to find out what is agreed to and narrow the scope of issues still not agreed to.  At Pretrial, the Judge often also tell the attorneys how they expect they might rule if the issues were presented at a full trial.  Oftentimes this information can help push one or both parties to be more reasonable in their settlement positions.


## Trial
If the parties cannot agree, a trial will be required.  Trials require a lot of preparation from the attorney, the parties, and any witnesses that may be involved.  This also means that trials are very expensive.  If trial is required, the Judge will set a series of deadlines and include a final trial date.  While the parties at this point are focused on preparing for trial, the preparation process itself can often lead to a settlement.  If not, the trial will occur on the given date and the Prove Up will follow. 


## Negotiation and Settlement
It is almost always in the best interest of both parties to reach a settlement.  Litigation is expensive, and with proper guidance and drafting, most of a parties' needs can be addressed and concerns can be protected against.  Attorneys for each side generally exchange 'redlined' versions of the JDM, MSA, and AJ until they can find language that works for everyone.  A good negotiation usually means that neither side is fully happy happy with the final result.  Eventually, when everyone is agreed, the parties will sign the MSA and the AJ and they will schedule a Prove Up.


## Prove Up
Prove Up is a formal hearing where the Judge will enter the JDM as an official Order.  The JDM's language will always incorporate the full text of the MSA 'by reference', meaning that the entirety of the MSA becomes enforceable as a court Order once the JDM is entered.  The Allocation Judgment will also be fully enforceable as a court Order.  The Prove Up itself is usually a very dry proceeding where the parties will be asked about basic facts of their background, marriage, and the terms of the MSA and AJ.  At the end of the proceeding, the Judge enters the Order, and you're (finally) divorced!

{/* ## Unexpectable Things to Expect

Whatever happens, it will be easier to deal with if we have given it some forethought. The most obvious thing to focus on is the election on November 3rd, but if 2020 has taught us anything so far, it’s that unexpected events can change everything in an instant. Here are a few things to be mentally prepared for.

**Covid gets really ugly.** The virus might survive a little bit longer in the cold air. People may be slightly more likely to congregate inside or slightly less diligent with masking. Each of these can increase the spread.

**Panic buying of food, ammunition, and toilet paper.** The empty shelves we all experienced at the beginning of the pandemic could again become a reality.

**Another police murder.** Protests over the police murder of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Elija McClean, and [others](https://interactive.aljazeera.com/aje/2020/know-their-names/index.html) have waned in numbers and intensity since the peak this summer. Another episode of police violence could very easily bring people back to the streets.

**Normalization of police checkpoints.** If protests re-erupt, authorities may crack down hard. Bill Bar has suggested [charging protestors with sedition](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/09/17/attorney-general-bill-barr-suggests-charging-protesters-sedition/3478435001/). Chicago already has a habit of shutting down all major entrances to the city, raising bridges, and [blockading intersections downtown](https://www.newsweek.com/chicago-police-guard-trump-tower-mexican-independence-day-1532182).

**False Flag Event.** A [false flag operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_flag) is an act of violence committed with the intention of pinning blame on someone else. It is used by political actors to gin up support for war or as an excuse to take away civil liberties from their opponents domestically. Hitler famously set parliament on fire and then used it as an excuse to assume dictatorial powers.

**Spontaneous Political Violence.** This has already occurred. At least [17 people](https://www.fox6now.com/news/deadly-unrest-here-are-the-people-who-have-died-amid-george-floyd-protests-across-us) have died amid the unrest following George Floyd's murder.

**Organized Political Violence.** Aside from seemingly random violence, there is the additional threat of organized violence. By this I mean people organizing themselves for the purpose of committing or threatening violence. Kyle Rittenhouse and the so called "patriot" militias who regularly show up to protests with assault rifles, bullet proof vests, and other tactical gear fall into this category.

**Targeted Political Violence (real or perceived)** - The assassination of any politician would send a shockwave through our system. But even a seemingly natural death could be problematic. The internet is already awash with outlandish conspiracy theories and second, third, and fourth level repercussions could be significant.


## Some Predictions

What I do predict is a very tense and long election season. Here are some specifics that I think are plausible or likely to occur. I’ve included my ballpark percentage likelihood for each, and where alternative outcomes are possible, I’ve labeled them A, B, C, etc.

**IF SOMEONE CONCEDES...**

1. More Democrats will vote by mail than Republicans (99%). This means many Democrat votes will not be counted until after election day

2. **Violence on Election Day (20%).** Long lines, frustrated voters, and a potentially heavy police presence could mean very high tensions on election day. A small fight could escalate to a violent arrest. An internet rumor regarding fraud could cause “patriot militias” to show up with guns to "protect" the election.

3. **OPTION 3A: Trump declares himself the winner on Election night (70%).** If it appears he is ahead in the Electoral College on November 3rd, Trump will not wait to declare himself the winner. Biden's votes are more likely to come via the mail, so he is unlikely to concede.

  **OPTION 3B: Trump declares the election was rigged on Election night (20%).** If it appears he is behind in the Electoral College, Trump will declare that the election was rigged and therefore invalid.

  **OPTION 3C: Trump concedes on election night (10%).** If there is a clear landslide on election night, Trump may be forced do concede if his inner circle, Senate Republicans, and/or military leaders force his hand.

**IF NO ONE CONCEDES...**

4. **OPTION 4A: Trump wins, Biden eventually concedes (25%).** Election officials or courts eventually declare Trump winner. Biden will likely concede. There may be sporadic violence, which Trump will crush with an iron fist.

**OPTION 4B: Biden wins, Trump eventually concedes (20%).** Election officials or courts eventually declare Biden winner and there is a peaceful transition of power. Having declared himself the winner, Trump tweets angrily for weeks as votes are counted. Finally declared the loser, hey may call for violence, but Twitter and facebook quickly shut down his account before anyone acts on it. His generals march into his office and inform him he will be removed by force if necessary. He reluctantly concedes.

**OPTION 4C: Biden wins, Trump challenges (25%).** Election officials or courts eventually declare Biden the winner and there is a period of turmoil and sporadic violence followed by a Biden presidency. Unfortunately, I think this is the most likely end game. I don’t believe Trump will concede under any circumstance. I think he will call for “patriots” to rise up against the evil democrats. If he loses the physical fight, eventually Trump might concede, perhaps making a deal to avoid prosecution as a traitor.

**OPTION 4D: Civil War (5%).** There is no shortage of people advocating for a civil war already. Ammunition and guns are sold out across the country. The only reason this percentage isn’t higher is because I've retained an irrational optimism that cooler heads will prevail.

**OPTION 4E. Intervening Event (25%).** I make no attempt to describe what this event could be. Let’s call it the 2020 wild card scenario. It could be a natural disaster, a false flag operation, or a spontaneous popular uprising. It could calm the situation or enflame it. Whatever it is, it could change the landscape in an instant.

## Conclusions

Things do not look good. There are still paths forward, but we cannot afford to live in denial. Only one presidential candidate has clearly and unequivocally denounced political violence of any kind. The other has a history of encouraging violence and demonizing opponents as evil scum.

As Maya Angelou put it, "When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time." We cannot wish our way into calmer waters. We must stare the ugliness in the face, buckle down, and weather this storm, together.
