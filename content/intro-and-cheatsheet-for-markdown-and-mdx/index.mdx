## Markdown basics

Markdown is a computer language used primarily for content formatting.  It has it's own file type, '.md' (example.md), which is human readable in its raw text format, but which can also be rendered to create well-formatted .html files for web sites or .doc or .pdf files for printed applications.  Many web applications (including this website!) can also render .md files directly.

Markdown is particularly usefull for blogging and documentation (instructions for developers about how a program works). It is standard practice for all projects to have a readme.md file in their root directory with written isntructions for how the program works.

## Markdown Cheatsheet with Examples
For each element below, I will include both the text as code as well as a rendered version.

### Markdown Example: Page Breaks

Typing three hyphens (dashes) (---) on a line by themselves with a empty row above and below creates a break in the text:

---

### Markdown Example: Using Bold, Italic, or Both
To make text bold, wrap it with **double stars.** (`**double stars**`)

To make text italic, wrap it with _underscore_. (`_underscore_`)

To make it bold and italic, _**use both**_ (`_**use both**_`)

---

### Markdown Example: Headings
These are the easiest, just start the row with '#' for each heading level, followed by a space before the text:
<Image
  src="/blogs/intro-and-cheatsheet-for-markdown-and-mdx/markdown-example-headings-text.png"
  width="400"
  height="200"
  alt="Image"
  sizes="100vw"
/>
when this is rendered, it looks like this:

<Image
  src="/blogs/intro-and-cheatsheet-for-markdown-and-mdx/markdown-example-headings.png"
  width="400"
  height="200"
  alt="Image"
  sizes="100vw"
/>

---

### Markdown Example: Images

```
<Image
  src="file-location/markdown-example-images.png"
  width="400"
  height="200"
  alt="Image"
  sizes="100vw"
/>
```
when rendered, this looks like this:

<Image
  src="/blogs/intro-and-cheatsheet-for-markdown-and-mdx/markdown-example-images.png"
  width="500"
  height="500"
  alt="Image"
  sizes="100vw"
/>

---

### Markdown Example: Block Quotes
To make a section of text block quotes, just use a '>' symbol followed by a space:
```
> This is what a block quote looks like...
```
When rendered, a block quote in markdown might look like this:

> This is what a block quote looks like...  It can be short or long and will wrap at the end if the quote is wider than the width of the window. 

> You can have multiple block quotes in a row, no problem.

---


### Markdown Example: Formatted Code Blocks
To get `code` formatting, wrap the text in single backticks (`).  For multiple lines, use triple backticks.

The `@tailwindcss/typography` adds a new `prose` class that you can add to any block vanilla HTML content and turn it into a well-formatted document:

```html
<article className="prose">
  <h1>Garlic bread with cheese: What the science tells us</h1>
  <p>
    For years parents have espoused the health benefits of eating garlic bread
    with cheese to their children, with the food earning such an iconic status
    in our culture that kids will often dress up as warm, cheesy loaf for
    Halloween.
  </p>
  <p>
    But a recent study shows that the celebrated appetizer may be linked to a
    series of rabies cases springing up around the country.
  </p>
</article>
```

### Markdown Example: Hyperlinks

You can easily make hyperlinks by surrounding the clickable text with '[]' followed by the link address surrounded by '()', like in this example:

```
A regular sentence with a [hyperlink to Google](www.google.com).
```
renders to:

A regular sentence with a [hyperlink to Google](www.google.com).
