## What is Q-Anon?

Imagine that you know a secret. It’s not a rumor. It’s not a theory. It’s an absolute truth that you’ve discovered all on your own: there is a secret cabal of powerful pedophiles raping children, drinking their blood and participating in satanic rituals in order to bring about the enslavement of the entire human race. How would you feel? How would you act?

Now imagine a country where millions of people with guns not only believe this, but are eagerly awaiting instructions from an anonymous internet poster about what to do about it. These posts will lead to the, “great awakening,” and initiate the, “annihilation of the Cabal and the liberation of the people.” Welcome to the 2020 elections where - like it or not - Q is on the ballot.

A substantial percentage of the population - [potentially millions](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/qanon-groups-have-millions-members-facebook-documents-show-n1236317) - believes the Q-Anon narrative. We need to wake up to the potential that this could lead to significant violence and do everything we can do to avoid that outcome. Rather than ignoring or laughing, we must seek understanding and connection. So let’s start with some terms you should know.

## Q-Anon Terminology


**Q** - A person (probably multiple people) who began posting anonymously on the internet in October 2018. They claim to be high level officials in the white house or the military. They work on behalf of the 99% against the Deep State and the Cabal. Their earliest posts contained specific predictions that did not come true. Since then, their posts have become more cryptic, encouraging followers to connect the dots on their own.

**Anons** - People who believe in the Q narrative.

**Sheep** - Anon term for people who are not Anons.

**Deep State** - The Deep State consists of government officials who work in the shadows to thwart Trump and take away our freedoms.

**The Cabal** - The central group of elites who are pulling the strings behind the scenes. They are the bankers, business people, politicians, and Hollywood elites who are systematically working to enslave humanity by controlling our money, government, and culture. They are also pedophiles and satanists.

**Q-Drops** - Posts from Q.

**Breadcrumbs** - Q-Drops contain Breadcrumbs - cryptic messages with hidden meanings. One post, alleged to be a cypher encoding an important message, was shown by a cyber-security consultant to be consistent with patterns created by someone randomly [slapping at a keyboard](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/9km87z/qanon-codes-are-random-typing).

”So my conclusion here is these are not actual codes, just random typing by someone who might play an instrument and uses a qwerty keyboard.” Mark Burnett, security consultant."

**4Chan** - An image and message board [website (warning, NSFW!)](http://www.4chan.org/) for anonymous posting. After Q posted here in October 2017, three users quickly shared the information across social media platforms, apparently spreading the narrative for [financial gain](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/how-three-conspiracy-theorists-took-q-sparked-qanon-n900531).

**8kun** - A [website (warning, NSFW!)](https://8kun.top/index.html) similar to 4chan. Q has posted here as well.

**PizzaGate** - In late 2016, WikiLeaks published about 20,000 emails from John Podesta’s account. Podesta was Chief of Staff to Bill Clinton, worked for Obama, and was then working on Hillary Clinton’s campaign. Anons believe these emails contained coded messages discussing child sex trafficking. The conclusion drawn by some was that elites within the democratic party were running a sex trafficking ring out of the pizzaria, complete with child sacrifice and satanic worship. The New York Times has a good summary of the alleged coded messages [here](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/12/10/business/media/pizzagate.html).

**Fall Cabal** - A series of [You Tube videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL18vrD9EPjAC7cQGB9fIzJcziJg4xwZkT) produced by a European woman who summarizes Q Anon for new people. A friend of mine who is an Anon recommended it to me. I watched all ten videos, each of which is 15-20 minutes. They are filled with really intense music, emotionally triggering photos, leading questions, and well-crafted cliff-hangers at the end of each video to keep you watching. Using the math found here, we can estimate that channel has earned between $70,000 and $120,000 from their 23 million YouTube views.

**Red Pilling** - A term adopted from the Matrix, red pilling is the process of recruiting people to Q-Anon.

**The Great Awakening** - Phrase used often by Anons to refer to the moment when all the Sheep wake up. Fall Cabal uses phrases like, “all will be revealed,” constantly and speaks about the annihilation of the Cabal.

**Question Everything** - Popular slogan for Anons.

**WWG1WGA** - Acronym for “Where we go one, we go all.” The slogan is inscribed on JFK’s memorial. Anons take this as proof of a master plan involving the Kennedys. It seems more likely that the anonymous poster adopted this slogan because it is related to JFK.

## Multiple Versions of THE TRUTH

Importantly, there is not one Q narrative. Anons are decentralized, each of them connecting their own dots. There are a few common threads outside of the pedophelia and devil worship mentioned above:

- Trump is Q, or is part of Q, or is being used by Q for Q’s agenda.
- Trump’s gaffes are actually secret messages to the public. Drinking water with two hands was a clue about child trafficking in fiji. Misspelling covfefe was a code, etc.
- The Deep State is trying to destroy Trump.
- JFK Jr. (who died in the 90’s) is actually still alive and well and working with Trump. He will reveal himself as Q.
- Migrant caravan in 2018 was fake and consisted of actors.
Masks are a hoax intended as a test of population control methods.

I could go on, but if you’ve read this far, you get the picture. And while the fact that there are millions of Anons is a valid cause for concern, we should not react with fear or ridicule.

We are living in the most psychologically stressful era in human history. Our senses are constantly bombarded with information and our biological impulse is to identify patterns. Add to the mix the fact that people can profit considerably from attention-grabbing headlines, posts, and videos, and it is not surprising that some have gone down the rabbit hole.

Instead, we should seek understanding, communication, and common ground. Personally, I can think of at least four areas of common ground with the Anons.

## Overlap Between Q and "the Left"

**The elite are killing us.** I don’t like the phrase “cabal” because it has anti-semetic connotations which are disgusting. But rhetoric regarding the 99% v. the 1% is something I can get behind.

**Question Everything.** I like the Q community’s emphasis on thinking for yourself and questioning the motives of people feeding us information. I think it's equally important to question yourself. Question your ego. Question the limits of your knowledge. Question the biases that may be affecting how you see the world.

**Pedophiles are bad.** Totally agree with them here. I’m not sold on the existence of an organized pedophile ring of Democratic operatives. That said, the Epstein saga definitely changed how I think about pedohelia as it relates to the elite. The fact that the President visited his island and that the jail was under his jurisdiction is suspicious. Until there is more tangible evidence, however, I’m not prepared to say that Donald Trump ordered Epstein killed to cover up Trump’s history of pedophelia. I don’t like Trump, but that would be an unfair leap at this time.

**WWG1WGA.** I don’t say this in solidarity with the Q community. Their fervor, anger, and self-righteousness makes me very uneasy. I say it as a metaphysical fact. As Dr. King said,

>“In a real sense all life is interrelated. All men are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.”

For better or worse, we are a single human family on a tiny planet. And I, for one, hope to God that we can figure this out together.
