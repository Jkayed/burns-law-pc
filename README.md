# SEO Optimized Personal Blog with Next.js, Contentlayer, and Tailwind CSS 
This personal blog / website is shared freely in hopes that it empowers non-technical professionals to build their brand and expand their skillset.  It was also a personal pain point for me, as someone who enjoys writing blog posts (and code!), but feels frustrated with current self-publishing options.

By leveraging the rich functionality of the new .mdx document standards and modern hosting and deployment solutions, every journalist can now can be both their own CTO and Editor in Chief!

## Quick Start (updated)

### 1. Connect to Firebase
- follow instructions from firebase to set up command line
- from top level directory, run `firebase init` in terminal
- This will create a file called 'firebaseConfig.js', which should be updated with the following changes:
```
// Import the functions from the SDKs
import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
import { getFirestore } from "firebase/firestore";


// Firebase configuration
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR-INFO-HERE",
  authDomain: "YOUR-INFO-HERE"",
  projectId: "YOUR-INFO-HERE"",
  storageBucket: "YOUR-INFO-HERE"",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR-INFO-HERE"",
  appId: "YOUR-INFO-HERE"",
  measurementId: "YOUR-INFO-HERE""
};

// Initialize Firebase
const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);

const db = getFirestore(app);

export {app, db}
```


### 2. Run the Development Server Locally:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


### 3.  Deploy
To deploy, run `firebase deploy --only hosting` from root directory.

#
## Overview
Entry point for app is `src/app/layout.js`

Each blog post contains the following:
```
/content/title-of-a-certain-blog/index.mdx # primary blog doc
/public/blogs/title-of-a-certain-blog/ # folder for blog images, files, etc

``` 

#
## Adding New Blog Post
**Add Post:**

1. Create new blog post directory "content/title-of-new-story" - the title of this directory will be used as the URL slug on the website, so use "all-lowercase-separated-with-dash" for new blog post directory folder names.
2. Create new file called "index.mdx" within the "content/url-of-new-blog-post" directory. Make sure to use template and update meta data tor title, description, image, etc.  Keep 'isPublished: false" until you are ready to publish. Add content using markdown for headings.
3. Create new images directory: public/blogs/title-of-new-story and add all photos/files here. IMPORTANT: make sure the title-of-new-story for this directory is exactly the same as the 'title-of-new-story' for the blog post directory. Place all images related to this blog post within this directory.  When embedding images (which you've placed in this folder), reference must be from from /public, i.e.: "/blogs/title-of-blog/title-of-image.png"
4. PUBLISH STEP 1: In index.mdx file, change 'isPublished: true', then save and close file.
5. PUBLISH STEP 2: In terminal, root folder for project, run "firebase deploy --only hosting".
    
**Update Featured**
By Default, "featured posts" will include the three most recent blog posts when sorted by the "publishedAt" flag in the meta data.To change this:
1. Open the file 'src/app/components/home/HomeCoverSection.js' to change the cover section.
2. Open the file 'src/app/components/home/FeaturedPosts.js' to change the featured posts section.

CONNECT FORM TO FIREBASE:
- [ ] Fix code for component at src/app/components/About/FormMain.js so that the form submits data to firestore database and includes some security to prevent spamming.  I have a firebaseconfig.json file in the main directory that seems to be configured appropriately because firebase Hosting and Google Analytics are working for me.

OTHER BUGS/FIXES:
- [ ] The component for the "about" page (app/(about)/about/page.js) is throwing an error saying I cannot tag the file with "use client" if I also want to "export metadata" ... I'd prefer to Export Metadata for SEO purposes, however I have this line commented out now to avoid an error.  When i do not tag with "use client", another error is thrown.  I'd like to be able to export metadata on this page.
- [ ] On the home page, the Featured Posts component (src/app/components/home/FeaturedPosts.js) is currently using the sortBlogs function to select articles to display.  I would prefer that I can reference three specific articles here based on the title of the article.
